---

_This demo is for demonstration purposes only._
**This code id also used in a copyrighted app for BBGrand Piano Studio and cannot be copied and reused without express owners consent**

This is a app built for the BBGrand Studio business to handle client managment. The intent of the application is for the clients of the BBGrand Piano Studio to be able to create a User profile with critical information needed by the Owner for business functions.

The User then can add there students taking lessons under their profile for the owner. This allows parent, who has User profile to manage their information without the business ower having to keep paper records of their clients.

The owner who is a Admin user can see all Users and Students upon their log in as well as email each User or all Users from the website to save time if needed.

The owner can also update, delete, edit or upgrade users to Admin privilgaes if the business expands to more than one owner.

The owner can also update, or delete individual students if needed.
